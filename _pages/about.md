<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am an incoming Ph.D. student at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), under the supervision of [Prof. Anyi Rao](https://anyirao.com/) and [Prof. Huamin Qu](http://www.huamin.org/). Currently, I am pursuing a master's degree in Control Science and Engineering at Zhejiang University.

My research interest includes 3D/4D generative models.
